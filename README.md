2021-07-26T13:04:16.6020084Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2021-07-26T13:04:16.6020935Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2021-07-26T13:04:16.6021737Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2021-07-26T13:04:16.6022225Z 
2021-07-26T13:04:16.6022767Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2021-07-26T13:04:16.6028435Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
2021-07-26T13:04:16.6028900Z 
2021-07-26T13:04:16.6029496Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2021-07-26T13:04:16.6029872Z 
2021-07-26T13:04:16.6030294Z Or undo this operation with:
2021-07-26T13:04:16.6030623Z 
2021-07-26T13:04:16.6031088Z   git switch -
